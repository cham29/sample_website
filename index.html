	<blockquote>
	  <p>
	    Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
	    Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>
	    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
	    And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
	  </p>

<h1>The Moment Of Truth</h1>
	<p>Why do bad things happen to good people? <br>
		It's lonely at the top at whatever you do <br>
		You've always got to watch motherfuckers around you <br>
		No body's invincible, no plan is bulletproof <br>
	And we all must mee our moment of truth.</p>
